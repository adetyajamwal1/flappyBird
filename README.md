Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive game where players control a bird by tapping the spacebar to make it flap its wings and navigate through a series of obstacles, which are pipes protruding from the top 
and bottom of the screen. The objective is to fly as far as possible without hitting any pipes. The game features retro-style graphics and straightforward mechanics, but its challenging nature and the need for 
precise timing made it incredibly popular and widely known for its addictive gameplay.
